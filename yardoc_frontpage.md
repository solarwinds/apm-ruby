# Welcome to the SolarWindsAPM Ruby Gem

The solarwinds_apm gem provides automatic tracing and metrics for Ruby applications.
It requires an SolarWinds account: sign up for a free trial at <https://www.solarwinds.com/solarwinds-observability/registration>.

## Documentation

<https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/default.htm#cshid=config-ruby-agent>

## Getting started

The gem instruments the ruby language and ruby on rails frameworks. It is hosted on RubyGems, making installation as
simple as: `gem install solarwinds_apm`.

Our ruby extension gets detailed insights out-of-the-box without any code modification.
For a list of instrumented gems and components see <https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/default.htm#cshid=config-ruby-agent>

Detailled installation instructions for Ruby and different frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Padrino, and Grape can be
found here <https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/default.htm#cshid=config-ruby-install>

## Custom instrumentation

If you have code or a library that is not on the platform support list, use our SDK (as documented here) to customize.
