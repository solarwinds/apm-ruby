      # Send counts
      #
      # Use this method to report the number of times an action occurs. The metric counts reported are summed and flushed every 60 seconds.
      #
      # === Arguments:
      #
      # * +name+          (String) Name to be used for the metric. Must be 255 or fewer characters and consist only of A-Za-z0-9.:-*
      # * +count+         (Integer, optional, default = 1): Count of actions being reported
      # * +with_hostname+ (Boolean, optional, default = false): Indicates if the host name should be included as a tag for the metric
      # * +tags_kvs+      (Hash, optional): List of key/value pairs to describe the metric. The key must be <= 64 characters, the value must be <= 255 characters, allowed characters: A-Za-z0-9.:-_
      #
      # === Example:
      #
      #   class WorkTracker
      #     def counting(name, tags = {})
      #       yield # yield to where work is done

      # Use this method to report a value for each or multiple counts. The metric values reported are aggregated and flushed every 60 seconds. The dashboard displays the average value per count.

      # === Arguments:
      #
      # * +name+          (String) Name to be used for the metric. Must be 255 or fewer characters and consist only of A-Za-z0-9.:-*
      # * +value+         (Numeric) Value to be added to the current sum
      # * +count+         (Integer, optional, default = 1): Count of actions being reported
      # * +with_hostname+ (Boolean, optional, default = false): Indicates if the host name should be included as a tag for the metric
